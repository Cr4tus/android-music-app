# Android Music App

The app uses Exoplayer API to play mp3 files (songs) which are being saved in a cloud database, using Google Firebase Firestore & Storage

## Programming Languages:
- Kotlin

## Frameworks & Libraries:
- Exoplayer - https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/exoplayer

## Implementation:
I've build this app almost 2 years ago, without using Android Jetpack Compose or other newer and more popular frameworks & libraries. It was one of the first Android apps that I've craeted from scratch, which can be also observed in the file architecture I've used. The app is not incredible, but the fact that I've succeeded in building & making it to run properly, was a big boost for my self-confidence as a developer at that time.
